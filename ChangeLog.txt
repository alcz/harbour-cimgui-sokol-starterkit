  * LICENSE
    * note about harbour additions, many thanks Andre Weissflog for making
      cimgui-sokol-starterkit self contained project and sokol project too

  * demo.c
    * diminish the role of sokol_main() and rename to hb_sokol_main(),
      we will use Harbour startup functions

  * sokol/sokol_app.h
    * note that debug routine will not work on default Win10 installation,
      though it probably does work on average D3D Windows programmer workstation.
      It is OK on default Win7 too

  + ChangeLog.txt
    + added Harbour style change log

  + cimgui/cimgui.hbc
  + cimgui/cimgui.hbp
  + sokol/sokol.hbc
  + sokol/sokol.hbp
  + hbdemo.hbp
  + cdemo.hbp
    + created Harbour style build/project files while looking at CMakeLists.txt

  + cdemo.prg
    + basic demo that builds using hbmk2 and goes through MAIN procedure, but still
      paints widgets from .c code

  + hbdemo.prg
    + test build displaying few widgets from .prg code, picking up some data
      using static variables passed as reference and updating them
  
  + cimgui/exstyles.cpp
  + cimgui/exstyles.h
    + added styling examples

  + cimgui/hbfunc.prg
    + hb_igAddFontFromFileTTF( <cFile>, <nSizePx>, <xConfig>, <xCdpList>, <lDefaultRange>, <lMerge> )
      hb_igAddFontFromMemoryTTF( <cBuffer>, <nSizePx>, <xConfig>, <xCdpList>, <lDefaultRange>, <lMerge> )

  + cimgui/hbfunc_.c
    + hb_igFps( @<nMs>[, @<nFps> ] ) -> frames/s
                                        (or ms/frame when 1 is passed in <nMs>)

    + internally called
      __igAddFont( <lBuf>, <cBufOrFile>, <nSizePx>, <xConfig>, <xCdpList>, <lDefaultRange>, <lMerge> )

  + cimgui/hbhlp.c
    + handling callbacks from Dear imgui code here

  + cimgui/hbimenum.ch
    + enums translated to #define's - output of generator/generator.prg

  + cimgui/hbimgui.cpp
    + wrappers to cimgui exported functions - output of generator/generator.prg
      We may eventually switch to calling .cpp exported methods directly, if there
      are no objections. While still using definitions from cimgui project I guess

  + generator/placeholder.txt
    + Harbour functions generator based on cimgui definitions will be here later
